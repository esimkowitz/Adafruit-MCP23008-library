Adapted for Particle IDE by Evan Simkowitz.
Still working on adapting the pullup resistors.
The best wiring diagram I've found is http://gtbtech.com/?p=875

Description from Adafruit:
This is very much beta, it seems to work fine but its not optimized and doesn't currently suport the interrupt capability of the chip

Currently it can do: setting pin directions, inputs and outputs and turning on/off the pull-up resistors

To use:
Connect pin #1 of the expander to Analog 5 (i2c clock)
Connect pin #2 of the expander to Analog 4 (i2c data)
Connect pins #3, 4 and 5 of the expander to ground (address selection)
Connect pin #6 and 18 of the expander to 5V (power and reset disable)
Connect pin #9 of the expander to ground (common ground)
Pins 10 thru 17 are your input/output pins
